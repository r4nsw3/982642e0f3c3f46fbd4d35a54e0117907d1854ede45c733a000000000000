  |   You're moving to the valley...                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew          |
  |   Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out    |
  |   to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn   |
  |   these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever   |
  |   since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all    |
  |   but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant   |
  |   hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of   |
  |   opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to   |
  |   restore Stardew Valley to greatness!                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Languages: English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese    |
  |   and Chinese.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Update/Patch Notes: v1.3.32 (v196608).                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Support for up to 4-player online co-op                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * You can invite 1-3 friends to join you in the valley, either        |
  |     starting from scratch or diving in from an existing single player   |
  |     save. Each player will have their own Cabin on the farm, and        |
  |     you'll be able to work together to achieve common goals such as     |
  |     farming, mining, fishing, foraging and festival participation       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The state of the Stardew Valley game world, including the main      |
  |     storyline, is shared between all players on the farm, as well as    |
  |     the pool of money you accumulate. However, each player will have    |
  |     their own private inventories, skills, achievements, collections,   |
  |     individual relationships, quests, and crafting/cooking recipes.     |
  |     As more hands are better than one, you may wish to change the       |
  |     difficulty level of your collective farm, which you can achieve     |
  |     by scaling the profit margins.In terms of marriage, players can     |
  |     choose to woo the eligible folks of Pelican Town, or craft a        |
  |     wedding ring to propose to a fellow player. If the other player     |
  |     accepts the ring, the couple becomes engaged                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Nintendo Switch features                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * On Nintendo Switch you'll be able to communicate with others on     |
  |     your farm using the Switch online voice chat or the new chat box    |
  |     feature with colored text                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * You can also play together via local communications play, meaning   |
  |     that 2-4 switch consoles can connect & play together over a short   |
  |     distance without the need for a Nintendo Switch Online account      |
  |                                                                         |

  |   * While the new 1.3 single player content has now been available on   |
  |     PC for a little while now, I'll keep things vague to avoid          |
  |     spoilers for anyone who hasn't come across them yet                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * For 3 days in Winter you'll be able to visit a traveling festival   |
  |     called the Night Market, which will visit Pelican Town. Here        |
  |     farmers can come and go as they please to purchase unique items,    |
  |     enjoy live entertainment and more                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * There are now new character events to encounter, including some     |
  |     secret events triggered by certain conditions... Some of these      |
  |     even grant you permanent bonuses                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * In Winter, farmers may encounter a strange event which activates    |
  |     a new 'secret' type of collection, leading to a new adventure and   |
  |     greater knowledge...                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Your horse can now wear hats and Signs are now craftable items,     |
  |     available to you from the beginning of the game                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Much more to be discovered                                          |
